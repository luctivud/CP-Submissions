1. We have to find the most optimal pair that utlised the maximum memory, so we will keep a variable current memory to store current utlised memory.
2. We store our optimal pairs in ans.
3. If any pair has more optimal usage, then we clear ans and replace it with subsequent usage.
4. We traverse on foreground process and find the most optimal pair in background using binary search (upper bound).
5. Complexity of this process is O(n.logn)
6. Space Complexity is O(1)
